# Voting example DApp on Truffle Framework.

This is a DApp example on Ethereum Ropsten testnet using Truffle Framework. It is deployed in Heroku: https://voting-dapp-ropsten.herokuapp.com

We develop a DApp where the users can create proposals and vote them. Of course, they can vote once per proposal with the options in support, against or absence.

[For Spanish speaking readers, you can read more about this tutorial](https://medium.com/@bukosabino/desarrollo-de-una-dapp-sobre-la-red-ethereum-1a4665c3856a).

# Preconditions to development

This dapp is based on the official tutorial to get start with Truffle Framework: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop and official tutorial to deploy on ropsten network: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/using-infura-custom-provider. So, I strongly recommend to read it before.

You need to pay attention to configure MetaMask and make sure you have enough ether in your account to do the deployment and use the dapp.

# Deployment on Heroku

* git clone https://github.com/bukosabino/truffle-voting-dapp-ropsten.git
* cd truffle-voting-dapp
* npm install -g truffle
* npm install
* truffle compile
* Configure settings variables to ropsten in truffle.js file:
  * var infura_apikey = "you need to register in Infura for an Access Token.";
  * var mnemonic = "< twelve words you can find in metamask/settings/reveal seed words >";
  * var address = "ropsten address with ether";
* truffle migrate --reset --network ropsten
  * Note: If you receive an error Error: Exceeds block gas limit, you may need to manually set the gas limit for your contract. See the Truffle Configuration documentation for details.
* git push heroku master

# Deployment on local

> You need delete bs-config.js file (only useful to heroku deployment).

* git clone https://github.com/bukosabino/truffle-voting-dapp-ropsten.git
* cd truffle-voting-dapp
* npm install -g truffle
* npm install
* truffle compile
* Configure settings variables to ropsten in truffle.js file:
  * var infura_apikey = "you need to register in Infura for an Access Token.";
  * var mnemonic = "< twelve words you can find in metamask/settings/reveal seed words >";
  * var address = "ropsten address with ether";
* truffle migrate --reset --network ropsten
  * Note: If you receive an error Error: Exceeds block gas limit, you may need to manually set the gas limit for your contract. See the Truffle Configuration documentation for details.
